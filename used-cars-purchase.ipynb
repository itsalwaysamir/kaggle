It's not always easy to tell if a used car is worth buying: one of the biggest challenges with used car auctions is the risk of a car having serious problems that prevent it from being resold to customers. These are so-called \"lemon cars\" - that is, cars that come out of the box with significant defects due to manufacturing errors that significantly affect the safety, use, or value of that car, and at the same time not in a reasonable number of repairs or within a given period can be remedied. In this case, the customer has the right to have the purchase price refunded. In addition to the acquisition costs, the wrong purchase of such \"lemon cars\" leads to considerable follow-up costs, such as the storage and repair of the car, which can result in losses when the vehicle is resold.\n\n> That's why it's important to the company to rule out as many bad purchases of \"lemon cars\" as possible. In order to relieve the buyers in the company with the huge number of offers, a model should be developed that predicts whether an offer would be a bad buy in the sense of a lemon car. However, this must not lead to too many good purchases being excluded. \n\n","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"# 1) Dataset Description

So it may be necessary to [resample](https://machinelearningmastery.com/random-oversampling-and-undersampling-for-imbalanced-classification/) your training dataset.\nMost machine learning algorithms assume that the data is evenly distributed within classes. In the case of class imbalance problems, the extensive issue is that the algorithm will be more biased towards predicting the majority class (no heart stroke in our case). The algorithm will not have enough data to learn the patterns present in the minority class (heart stroke). This technique is used to upsample or downsample the minority or majority class. When we are using an imbalanced dataset, we can oversample the minority class using replacement. This technique is called oversampling.

It detects 185 good cars as lemon cars which is not too bad (false positive).\n\nWith an overall f1 score of 34.6%, logistic regression is better at recognizing lemon cars and good cars individually but considering errors involved, false positive and false negative, it shows still lower predictability performance.\n","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"# 15) Improvements\n\nOne of the main challenges of this analysis is feature engineering. Of course, there is no perfect solution or method but there are some points that can be considered for the next steps:\n- In this analysis, we used imputed the missing values using the median for numerical values. It would be a good idea to try other methods for data imputation\nsuch as kNN, most frequent, etc. For more details please see [Introduction to Data Imputation](https://www.simplilearn.com/data-imputation-article\n        \n- Different resampling can be applied. For example, Synthetic Minority Oversampling Technique or SMOTE is another technique to oversample the minority class. Simply adding duplicate records of minority class often don’t add any new information to the model. Please see [here](https://medium.com/@corymaklin/synthetic-minority-over-sampling-technique-smote-7d419696b88c) for more details.\n- Ensembling models might be an improvement step. In order for a machine learning model to react quickly to changes in the training data (high variance,           potentially overfitting) without losing stability at the same time (low bias), methods were developed that combine models with each other.\n  The hope is that the resulting meta-models will generate better predictions than any individual model that composes them. One can use VotingClassifier from scikeat-learn module. VotingClassifier combines predictions to make the meta-model produce more robust predictions.\n- In this analysis, grid search methods were used to find the best hyperparameter for our models. Different optimal sets and combinations of hyperparameters can be implemented to see if it leads to better model performance.
